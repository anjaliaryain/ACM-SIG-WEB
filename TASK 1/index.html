    <p style=" color:rgb(25, 170, 253);font-size:20px; ">Amazon Prime is a paid subscription program from Amazon which is available in various countries and gives users access to additional services otherwise unavailable or available at a premium to other Amazon customers. Users: 200 million. Amazon Prime
        is a paid subscription service — $119 per year or $12.99 per month — that gives Amazon shoppers a variety of perks. The biggest perk, however, is free one- or two-day shipping on most items sold by Amazon. CEO Jeff Bezos has stated that Amazon
        has over 150 million paid Prime members worldwide.

    <p style=" color:rgb(25, 170, 253);font-size:20px; ">Although Amazon Video started out as a place to purchase and watch TV shows and movies, the industry has changed and Amazon has embraced the world of unlimited, buffet-style streaming for a single monthly fee. Take, for example, Amazon's growing library
        of excellent original content such as Bosch, Catastrophe, Electric Dreams, Fleabag, Good Omens, Homecoming, Hunters, Jack Ryan, Tales From The Loop, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Patriot, The Boys, Undone, Upload, and UtopiaUtopia. Amazon even saved
        The Expanse from cancellation. Amazon is also producing a series based on the Fallout franchise, one set in the world of Lord of the Rings, and one based on the mammoth Wheel of Time fantasy series. The list of originals continues to grow, and
        while it's not as large as Netflix's or HBO Max's collection, many of the shows are on par, quality-wise. Prime Video's original shows also outclass Hulu's.
